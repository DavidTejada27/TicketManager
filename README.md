# Ticket Manager

## Overview

Ticket Manager is a React-based project designed to manage and track tickets efficiently. The application demonstrates the implementation of key React concepts, showcasing best practices and methodologies.

## Features

- **Reducers**: Utilized for state management, enabling predictable state transitions and better scalability.
- **Prop Drilling**: Implemented to pass data through multiple layers of components.
- **Reusable Components**: Built modular and reusable components to ensure maintainability and ease of updates.
- **PropType Validation**: Ensured type-checking of props to enhance reliability and prevent runtime errors.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticket-manager.git

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

## Key Concepts

- **Reducers**: Centralized state management using `useReducer` for predictable updates.
- **Prop Drilling**: Data is passed from parent to child components for controlled communication.
- **PropType Validation**: Added type safety for props using the `PropTypes` library to reduce bugs.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a backend API for dynamic data management.
- Implementation of a global state management library like Redux or Context API to minimize prop drilling.
- Addition of unit and integration tests to improve reliability.
